The mango tree is a tropical fruit tree that grows in warm climates. It has a thick trunk, many branches, and long green leaves. Mango trees produce sweet, juicy fruits called mangoes, which can be yellow, orange, or red when ripe. These fruits are enjoyed fresh, in juices, or used in cooking. Mango trees need plenty of sunlight and water to grow well, and they can live for many years.
