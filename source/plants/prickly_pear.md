The prickly pear is a type of cactus known for its flat, paddle-shaped pads that are covered in clusters of tiny spines. It grows in warm, dry regions and is often found in deserts and rocky areas. In the spring and summer, the prickly pear blooms with bright yellow, pink, or red flowers, which later turn into edible fruits called “tunas.” These fruits are sweet and juicy, and both the pads and fruit can be eaten when prepared carefully. The prickly pear is not only an important food source for animals and people but also adds vibrant color to the desert landscape.
