A lily is a beautiful flowering plant known for its large, elegant blooms and sweet fragrance. Lilies usually grow from bulbs and have tall, slender stems with long, narrow leaves. Their flowers come in many colors, including white, pink, orange, yellow, and red, and often have spots or streaks on the petals. Lilies bloom mainly in the summer and are popular in gardens and bouquets because of their striking appearance. They grow best in sunny spots with well-drained soil and need regular watering to stay healthy.
