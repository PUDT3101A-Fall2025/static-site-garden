They are evergreen vines, growing to heights of 20 metres (66 ft) in trees, climbing by means of aerial roots which act as hooks over branches; these roots will also grow into the soil to help support the plant. Since plants in the genus root both into the soil and over trees, it is considered a hemiepiphyte with roots in soil but climbing on trees.[4] Aerial roots hanging directly to the ground have, according to Madison, measured up to 30 m (98 ft) long.[5]
