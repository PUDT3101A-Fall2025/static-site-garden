The saguaro cactus is a tall, tree-like plant that grows in the deserts of the American Southwest. It has a thick, green stem covered with sharp spines and can grow arms that reach upward, giving it a distinctive shape. Saguaros store water inside their stems, allowing them to survive in hot, dry conditions. In the spring, they bloom with beautiful white flowers, and later produce red fruit that provides food for birds and other animals. These cacti can live for over 150 years and are an iconic symbol of the desert.
