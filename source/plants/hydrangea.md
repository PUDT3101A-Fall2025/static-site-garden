A hydrangea is a flowering plant known for its large, round clusters of colorful blooms. The flowers can be pink, blue, white, or purple, and their color can change depending on the soilâ€™s acidity. Hydrangeas have broad green leaves and usually grow as bushes or shrubs. They bloom in the spring and summer, adding bright colors to gardens. Hydrangeas need regular watering and do best in places with both sun and shade.
